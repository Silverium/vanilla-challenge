# Vanilla Challenge
I've been chanllenged to create an app with vanilla code. No React, no Vue, no Angular, no lodash, no Bootstrap (twitter), no Material design...


# Usage

You need [git](https://git-scm.com/) and [node.js](https://nodejs.org/) on your computer before running. [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) is also a good alternative tool to npm

1. `git clone https://github.com/Silverium/vanilla-challenge your-project-name`
2. `npm install` or `yarn`
3. `npm start` or `yarn dev`

You're all set, start coding 👩‍💻👨‍💻 !

4. `npm run build` or `yarn build` when you're ready to upload your site to your FTP / hosting platform of choice. This will create a `dist` folder with all your website assets optimized and compressed.
