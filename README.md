# Vanilla Challenge
I've been chanllenged to create an app with vanilla code. No React, no Vue, no Angular, no lodash, no Bootstrap (twitter), no Material design...


# Usage

You need [git](https://git-scm.com/) and [node.js](https://nodejs.org/) on your computer before running. [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) is also a good alternative tool to npm

1. `git clone https://github.com/Silverium/vanilla-challenge your-project-name`
2. `npm install` or `yarn`
3. `npm start` or `yarn dev`

You're all set, start coding üë©‚Äçüíªüë®‚Äçüíª !

4. `npm run build` or `yarn build` when you're ready to upload your site to your FTP / hosting platform of choice. This will create a `dist` folder with all your website assets optimized and compressed.


# Description of the challenge
## Apdex Board - Code exercise
We want to build a new page view that shows the list of applications running on every host.
- An application has a name, a list of contributors, a release version number, and a list of
hosts that the app has been deployed at.
- Each application has an Apdex metric assigned. The Apdex score is a positive integer
between 0 (Frustrated) and 100 (Satisfied). Apdex is an industry standard to measure
users' satisfaction based on the response time of web applications and services.
You are asked to build a new feature to display the most satisfying applications deployed on
each host. You can find a JSON file [(host-app-data.json)](https://github.com/Silverium/vanilla-challenge/blob/master/src/mocks/host-app-data.json) with the data required for
this exercise.
- You must write object oriented code that:
  - Models the described problem with a suitable class hierarchy.
  - Includes a method (‚Äú**getTopAppsByHost**‚Äù) that, given a hostname, retrieves a list
of the 25 most satisfying applications.
  - Implements the ‚Äú**addAppToHosts**‚Äù and ‚Äú**removeAppFromHosts**‚Äù methods, which
update the list of applications with higher Apdex whenever any of these methods
is called. Be warned that when an app gets removed, ‚ÄúgetTopAppsByHost‚Äù still
has to return 25 items.

- You must implement a UI, based on the provided mockups ([list-mode](https://github.com/Silverium/vanilla-challenge/blob/master/list-mode.jpg), [grid-mode](https://github.com/Silverium/vanilla-challenge/blob/master/grid-mode.jpg), [grid-mode-sizing](https://github.com/Silverium/vanilla-challenge/blob/master/grid-mode-sizing.jpg)):
  - Each card representing a host must display its top 5 apps ordered by
satisfaction.
  - As shown in the mocksup, there are two types of layouts (grid and list) and when
clicking on the checkbox the layout changes.
  - When clicking over an app, an alert dialog including the release number has to
be shown.
  - Browser support: IE11+, latest 2 versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Opera.

## Requirements and restrictions
- Each application list is always ordered by Apdex. The first app is the one with the
highest Apdex. From top to bottom, most satisfied to most frustrated app.
- For this specific solution, you not need to worry about changes on the Apdex metric of
an application.
- Please provide source code, not the compiled code.
Things we are looking for
- Maintainable and well-written code using good object oriented practices.
- Specify Big-O notation of your algorithm. You should strive for an optimal solution.
Things that we are NOT looking for
- Database or any data source connection or any kind of ORM. It‚Äôs OK to read the
provided JSON file all at once.
- Using 3rd party libraries such as JS or CSS libraries (i.e Angular, React...). Except for
the ones to assist your development such as test or build frameworks.
